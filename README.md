## Resources
- [Back to top](https://codyhouse.co/gem/back-to-top)
The back to top is located on the bottom left of the site. I think this is a good feature to include because it allows the user to scroll back to the top with a click of a button. I liked this because it was easy to incorporate.
- [Textillate](http://textillate.js.org/)
I added this textillate text effect on the hero text. It gives the text quite the entrance!
- [Tabs for menu](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_tabs.asp)
This was incorporated in the links in the menu section. When you click on one of the tabs, you it will reveal that menu section below it.

## Deduction

## Comments
I gave it the old college try! I know some things are broken, I apologize. I couldn't get the lazee menu to load so I scrapped it. Thanks for a great semester!
